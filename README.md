<h1>G-12</h1>

<h2>ABOUT THE GAME</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>G-12 is a Command Line Based game project, made using Python</li>
		<li>It uses the libraries such as random, os, time, csv, and mysql.connector</li>
		<li>It consists of several fun games, a quiz, and an IQ game</li>
		<li>It consists of a (not so robust and extremely basic) login system.</li>
		<li>If you forgot your password, you can use Forgot Password feature to retreive the password.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install "mysql.connector" using pip, because I lost the build before implementing MySQL connectivity</li>
		<li>Install "Python" and then run the "CS_Project_File.py" file, to experience the entire application</li>
		<li>If you want to play only the games, and are not concerned about the login system, run the "Games.py" file</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>WHAT'S NEXT?</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Remove the MySQL dependency and implement NoSQL or maybe host MySQL over a global server</li>
	</ul>
</p>
